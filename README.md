# Data Analytics and Machine Learning Projects
Welcome to my GitHub repository for data analytics and machine learning projects! This folder is dedicated to putting into practice the challenges encountered in my professional certifications. I analyze case studies using Data Analytics and Machine Learning methods, utilizing tools such as R Studio, SQL Server Management Studio, and Visual Studio Code.

## Contents:
Case Studies: This folder contains detailed case studies that I've analyzed.

Data Files: The "data" folder includes CSV files and other datasets used in the case studies for data analysis and model training.

Scripts: The "scripts" folder contains R scripts, SQL queries, and Python scripts used for data preprocessing, analysis, modeling, and visualization.

Reports: In the "reports" folder, you'll find documentation, reports, and summaries of the analyses and findings from each case study.

## Tools Used:
R Studio: Used for statistical analysis, data visualization, and building machine learning models using R programming.
SQL Server Management Studio: Utilized for data querying, database management, and integrating data from relational databases.
Visual Studio Code: Used for coding and scripting tasks, including Python scripts for machine learning and data manipulation.

## How to Use:
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to specific case study folders to access the analysis scripts, data files, and reports.
Open the scripts in the appropriate IDE (R Studio, SQL Server Management Studio, or Visual Studio Code) to run and analyze the code.
Feel free to explore the projects, datasets, and scripts. I hope these projects provide insights into data analytics and machine learning methodologies in real-world scenarios.
